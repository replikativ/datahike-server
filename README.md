# Datahike Server

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Freplikativ%2Fdatahike-server%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

With Datahike Server you can run your Datahike with a REST interface. Deploy
Datahike with the backend of your choice and run it in a container or on a VM.
Push the button to deploy Datahike as a Container Instance on MS Azure with
a file backend.

## Build Datahike Server

`clj -T:build uber` builds an uberjar into the `target/`-directory.

## Run Datahike Server

Run Datahike Server in dev-mode without any authentication:

`DATAHIKE_SERVER_DEV_MODE=true java -jar datahike-server-0.1.84-standalone.jar`

Adjust the command according to the version you built into the `target/`-directory.

## Configuring Datahike Server
### File Configuration

Datahike Server loads configuration from `resources/config.edn` relative to the
current directory. This file has a number of options and overwrites all other
configuration given via environment or properties. Below you can find an example
to configure both Datahike and the server.
```
{:databases [{:store {:backend :file
                      :path "/tmp/dh-2"}
             :schema-on-read true
             :temporal-index false}]
 :server {:port 3000
          :join? false
          :dev-mode false
          :token :yourtoken
          :loglevel :debug}}
```

### Configuration via Environment and Properties

Datahike Server can also be configured via environment variables and java system
properties. Please take a look at the [configuration of Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike/blob/development/doc/config.md) to get an
overview of the number of possible configuration options regarding the database.
To configure the server please see the options below. Like in Datahike they are
read via the [environ library by weavejester](https://github.com/weavejester/environ).
Please provide the logging level without colon. Beware that a configuration file
overwrites the values from environment and properties.

properties                  | envvar                   | default
----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------
datahike.server.port        | DATAHIKE_SERVER_PORT     | 3000
datahike.server.join        | DATAHIKE_SERVER_JOIN     | false
datahike.server.loglevel    | DATAHIKE_SERVER_LOGLEVEL | :info
datahike.server.dev.mode    | DATAHIKE_SERVER_DEV_MODE | false
datahike.server.token       | DATAHIKE_SERVER_TOKEN    | no default

### Authentication

You can authenticate to Datahike-Server with a token specified via configuration. Please
then send the token within your request headers as `authentication: token <yourtoken>`.
If you don't want to use authentication during development you can set dev-mode to true
in your configuration and just omit the authentication-header. Please be aware that your
Datahike Server might be running publicly accessible and then your data might be read
by anyone and the server might be misused if no authentication is active.

### Logging

We are using the [library taoensso.timbre by Peter Taoussanis](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre/) to provide
meaningful log messages. Please set the loglevel that you prefer via means
of configuration below. The possible levels are sorted in order from least
severe to most severe:
- trace
- debug
- info
- warn
- error
- fatal
- report
